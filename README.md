## Digital Geography Portfolio
A showcase of the digital technologies built using skills taught from GEOG 258 at the University of Washington. All data gathered and rendered has been personally gathered and curated to best align my hobbies and interests. The two main technologies showcased are Google Maps and CartoDB.
